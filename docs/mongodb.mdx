# MongoDB Documentation

This guide introduces MongoDB fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

MongoDB is a NoSQL document database for high-volume data storage. It uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, offering flexibility and scalability. Ideal for big data, real-time analytics, and content management.

## MongoDB Fundamentals

### Documents

Data stored as BSON documents (binary JSON). Fields can vary per document.

### Collections

Groups of documents, similar to tables in relational databases.

### Databases

Containers for collections.

## CRUD Operations

Create, read, update, delete with methods like `insertOne`, `find`, `updateOne`, `deleteOne`.

## Querying

Use query operators for filtering, projection, and sorting.

## Aggregation

Pipeline stages transform and analyze data.

## Indexing

Indexes improve query performance. Types include single field, compound, and text.

## Schema Design

Embed or reference documents based on access patterns.

## Replication

Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability.

## Sharding

Distributes data across clusters for horizontal scaling.

## Transactions

Multi-document transactions ensure consistency.

## Best Practices

Design schemas for read/write patterns, use indexes wisely, and monitor performance.

## Drivers

Official drivers for languages like Node.js, Python, Java.
