# Java Documentation

This guide introduces Java programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It emphasizes portability, security, and robustness, making it ideal for enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems.

## Java Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are declared with types, and Java is statically typed. Primitive data types include:

- **byte**: 8-bit signed integer.
- **short**: 16-bit signed integer.
- **int**: 32-bit signed integer.
- **long**: 64-bit signed integer.
- **float**: 32-bit floating-point.
- **double**: 64-bit floating-point.
- **char**: 16-bit Unicode character.
- **boolean**: True or False.

Reference types include classes, interfaces, and arrays.

### Strings

Strings are immutable objects in Java. The `String` class provides methods for manipulation, comparison, and formatting. `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are used for mutable strings.

### Arrays

Arrays are fixed-size, homogeneous collections. They can be single or multi-dimensional. The `Arrays` class provides utility methods for operations.

### Collections

The Collections Framework includes interfaces like `List`, `Set`, and `Map`, with implementations such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`.

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

Control flow uses `if`, `else if`, and `else`. The switch statement supports branching based on values.

### Loops

`for`, enhanced `for` (for-each), `while`, and `do-while` loops handle iteration. Loop control uses `break` and `continue`.

## Methods

Methods define behavior in classes. They can have parameters, return types, and modifiers like `public`, `private`, `static`. Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.

## Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

Java is fundamentally object-oriented. Classes encapsulate data and behavior. Key concepts include inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Interfaces define contracts, and abstract classes provide partial implementations.

## Error Handling

Exception handling uses `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`. Checked and unchecked exceptions ensure robust error management.

## File Operations

The `java.io` and `java.nio` packages provide classes for reading and writing files, handling paths, and managing file systems.

## Generics

Generics enable type-safe collections and methods, preventing runtime type errors.

## Concurrency

Java supports multi-threading with the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface. The `java.util.concurrent` package provides high-level concurrency utilities.

## JVM and Memory Management

Understanding the JVM, garbage collection, and memory management is crucial for performance optimization.

## Best Practices

Follow Java naming conventions, use access modifiers appropriately, and leverage design patterns. Ensure thread safety and handle exceptions properly.

## Testing

JUnit is the standard testing framework for Java, supporting unit tests and integration tests.

## Performance Optimization

Profile applications, optimize algorithms, and use efficient data structures. JVM tuning can improve performance.

## Deployment

Java applications are packaged as JAR files or deployed to application servers. Build tools like Maven and Gradle manage dependencies and builds.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include classpath problems, memory leaks, and concurrency bugs. Use debugging tools and logging frameworks like Log4j.

## Development Setup

Install the JDK, set up an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, and configure build tools. Use version control and continuous integration for collaborative development.
