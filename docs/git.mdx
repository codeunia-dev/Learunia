# Git Documentation

This guide introduces Git version control fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code. It enables collaboration, branching, and history management. Essential for modern software development.

## Git Fundamentals

### Repositories

Local and remote repositories store project history.

### Commits

Snapshots of changes with messages describing modifications.

### Branches

Parallel development lines. `main`/`master` is default.

### Staging Area

Prepares changes for commit with `git add`.

## Basic Commands

- `git init`: Initialize repository.
- `git clone`: Copy remote repository.
- `git add`: Stage changes.
- `git commit`: Save staged changes.
- `git status`: Check repository state.
- `git log`: View commit history.

## Branching and Merging

- `git branch`: Create/manage branches.
- `git checkout`: Switch branches.
- `git merge`: Combine branches.
- `git rebase`: Reapply commits on new base.

## Remote Repositories

- `git remote`: Manage remotes.
- `git push`: Upload to remote.
- `git pull`: Download and merge.
- `git fetch`: Download without merging.

## Collaboration

Pull requests, code reviews, and forking facilitate team work.

## Best Practices

Commit often, write clear messages, use branches for features, and review code.

## GitHub/GitLab

Platforms for hosting repositories, issue tracking, and CI/CD.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include merge conflicts, lost commits, and repository corruption. Use `git reflog` for recovery.

## Development Setup

Install Git, configure user settings, and use GUI clients like GitHub Desktop.
