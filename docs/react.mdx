# React Documentation

This guide introduces React programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture and virtual DOM for efficient rendering. Developed by Facebook, React emphasizes declarative programming and reusability.

## React Fundamentals

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React apps. They can be functional or class-based. Functional components use hooks for state and lifecycle.

### JSX

JSX is a syntax extension allowing HTML-like code in JavaScript. It compiles to `React.createElement` calls.

### Props

Props pass data from parent to child components. They are immutable.

### State

State manages component data that changes over time. Use `useState` hook in functional components.

## Hooks

Hooks like `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer` manage side effects, context, and complex state.

## Lifecycle Methods

Class components use methods like `componentDidMount`. Functional components use `useEffect`.

## Event Handling

Events are handled with camelCase syntax (e.g., `onClick`). Event handlers are functions.

## Conditional Rendering

Use conditional operators or logical && for dynamic content.

## Lists and Keys

Render lists with `map()`. Keys help React identify changes.

## Forms

Controlled components manage form state. Libraries like Formik simplify complex forms.

## Context API

Context provides global state without prop drilling.

## Best Practices

Keep components small, use functional components with hooks, and optimize with `React.memo` and `useMemo`.

## Testing

Jest and React Testing Library test components and interactions.

## Performance Optimization

Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and lazy loading to optimize renders.

## Deployment

Build with Create React App or Vite. Deploy to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include infinite loops, prop drilling, and key warnings. Use React DevTools for debugging.

## Development Setup

Use Create React App for quick starts. Set up ESLint, Prettier, and version control.
