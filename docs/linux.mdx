# Linux Documentation

This guide introduces Linux operating system fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Linux is an open-source Unix-like OS kernel powering distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS. It offers command-line tools, scripting, and server management. Essential for development, DevOps, and system administration.

## Linux Fundamentals

### File System

Hierarchical structure with root `/`. Directories like `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`.

### Permissions

Read, write, execute for user, group, others. `chmod`, `chown` manage permissions.

### Processes

`ps`, `top`, `kill` manage running processes.

### Users and Groups

`useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd` handle accounts.

## Command Line

### Basic Commands

- `ls`: List files.
- `cd`: Change directory.
- `cp`: Copy files.
- `mv`: Move/rename.
- `rm`: Remove files.
- `mkdir`: Create directories.

### Text Processing

`grep`, `sed`, `awk` manipulate text.

### Package Management

`apt`, `yum`, `pacman` install software.

## Shell Scripting

Bash scripts automate tasks with variables, loops, conditionals.

## Networking

`ifconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`, `ssh` handle network operations.

## System Administration

Logs in `/var/log`, services with `systemctl`, backups with `rsync`.

## Best Practices

Use version control for configs, automate with scripts, and secure with firewalls.
