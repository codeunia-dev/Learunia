# Node.js Documentation

This guide introduces Node.js programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model for scalable network applications. Ideal for APIs, real-time apps, and microservices.

## Node.js Fundamentals

### Modules

Node.js uses CommonJS (`require`) or ES6 modules (`import`). Core modules include `fs`, `http`, `path`.

### Asynchronous Programming

Callbacks, Promises, and async/await handle asynchronous operations. Event loop manages concurrency.

### File System

The `fs` module provides synchronous and asynchronous file operations.

### HTTP Server

Create servers with the `http` module. Express.js simplifies routing and middleware.

## NPM and Packages

NPM manages dependencies. `package.json` defines project metadata and scripts.

## Express.js

Express is a web framework for routing, middleware, and request handling.

## APIs and REST

Build RESTful APIs with Express. Handle JSON data and HTTP methods.

## Databases

Connect to databases like MongoDB (with Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (with pg).

## Authentication

Implement auth with JWT, Passport.js, or OAuth.

## Error Handling

Use try-catch, middleware, and process events for robust error management.

## Testing

Frameworks like Jest and Mocha test Node.js applications.

## Performance Optimization

Profile with tools like clinic.js. Use clustering for multi-core utilization.

## Deployment

Deploy to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel. Use PM2 for process management.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include callback hell, memory leaks, and dependency conflicts. Use debugging tools and logging.

## Development Setup

Install Node.js and NPM. Use editors with Node support. Set up version control and CI/CD.
