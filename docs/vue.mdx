# Vue.js Documentation

This guide introduces Vue.js programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It focuses on the view layer, offering a component-based architecture with reactive data binding. Vue is approachable, versatile, and performant, suitable for small projects and large applications.

## Vue.js Fundamentals

### Vue Instance

Create Vue apps with `new Vue()`. The instance manages data, methods, and lifecycle.

### Templates

Templates use declarative syntax with directives like `v-bind`, `v-if`, `v-for`.

### Data Binding

Reactive data binding updates the DOM automatically. Use `v-model` for two-way binding.

### Directives

Directives add behavior: `v-show`, `v-on`, `v-bind`, etc.

### Components

Components encapsulate reusable UI parts. They have templates, scripts, and styles.

## Computed Properties and Watchers

Computed properties cache derived data. Watchers react to data changes.

## Lifecycle Hooks

Hooks like `mounted`, `updated`, `destroyed` manage component lifecycle.

## Event Handling

`v-on` handles events. Methods define event logic.

## Conditional Rendering

`v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-else` control visibility.

## List Rendering

`v-for` renders lists with keys for efficient updates.

## Forms

`v-model` binds form inputs. Modifiers handle special cases.

## Vue Router

Router manages single-page navigation with routes and components.

## Vuex

Vuex provides centralized state management for complex apps.

## Composition API

Vue 3's Composition API organizes logic with `setup()`, `ref()`, `reactive()`.

## Best Practices

Use single-file components, follow Vue style guide, and optimize with lazy loading.

## Testing

Vue Test Utils and Jest test components and logic.

## Performance Optimization

Use `v-memo`, async components, and tree-shaking for optimization.

## Deployment

Build with Vue CLI. Deploy to static hosts or server-side render with Nuxt.js.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include reactivity problems, key warnings, and build errors. Use Vue DevTools.

## Development Setup

Use Vue CLI for scaffolding. Set up ESLint and version control.
