# C++ Documentation

This guide introduces C++ programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that extends C with object-oriented features, generics, and modern abstractions. It provides low-level control with high-level constructs, making it suitable for system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

## C++ Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are declared with types, and C++ is statically typed. Fundamental types include:

- **int**: Integer types (short, int, long, long long).
- **float/double**: Floating-point types.
- **char**: Character types.
- **bool**: Boolean type.
- **void**: Absence of type.

Pointers and references allow memory manipulation. User-defined types include structs, classes, and enums.

### Strings

C++ provides `std::string` from the Standard Library for string handling, supporting concatenation, comparison, and manipulation.

### Arrays and Vectors

Arrays are fixed-size collections. `std::vector` provides dynamic arrays with automatic memory management.

### Pointers and Memory Management

Pointers store memory addresses. Manual memory management with `new` and `delete` is powerful but error-prone. Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`) provide safer alternatives.

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

`if`, `else if`, and `else` control branching. The switch statement handles multiple cases.

### Loops

`for`, range-based `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops support iteration. Loop control uses `break` and `continue`.

## Functions

Functions can be overloaded and templated. They support default arguments and references for efficiency.

## Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

C++ supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes define objects with data members and member functions. Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism.

## Templates and Generic Programming

Templates allow generic code that works with any type, enabling reusable algorithms and data structures.

## Error Handling

Exception handling uses `try`, `catch`, and `throw`. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) ensures resource cleanup.

## File Operations

The `<fstream>` library provides classes for file input/output. Streams handle reading and writing data.

## Standard Template Library (STL)

The STL includes containers (vector, list, map), algorithms (sort, find), and iterators for efficient programming.

## Concurrency

C++11 introduced threads and synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables.

## Best Practices

Use RAII, avoid raw pointers, and prefer STL containers. Follow the Rule of Three/Five for resource management.

## Testing

Frameworks like Google Test support unit testing in C++.

## Performance Optimization

Profile code, optimize algorithms, and use appropriate data structures. Compiler optimizations and inline functions improve performance.

## Deployment

C++ code is compiled to executables or libraries. Cross-platform development requires consideration of compilers and platforms.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include memory leaks, undefined behavior, and compilation errors. Use debuggers like GDB and sanitizers.

## Development Setup

Install a compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC), set up an IDE (Visual Studio, CLion), and use build systems like CMake. Version control and continuous integration are essential.
