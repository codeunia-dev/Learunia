# Swift Documentation

This guide introduces Swift programming fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Swift is Apple's modern, safe, and fast language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS development. It combines performance with ease of use, replacing Objective-C.

## Swift Fundamentals

### Variables and Constants

`var` for mutable, `let` for immutable. Type inference.

### Data Types

`Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Bool`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, `Set`.

### Optionals

Handle absence of value safely with `?` and `!`.

### Control Flow

`if`, `switch`, `for-in`, `while`, `repeat-while`.

## Functions

Define with `func`, parameters, return types. Closures for anonymous functions.

## Classes and Structures

Classes for reference, structs for value types. Inheritance, protocols.

## Protocols

Define interfaces. Extensions add functionality.

## Error Handling

`try`, `catch`, `throw` with `Error` protocol.

## Generics

Reusable code with type parameters.

## Memory Management

Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

## Best Practices

Use structs over classes, handle errors, write readable code.

## Testing

XCTest framework for unit and UI tests.

## Performance Optimization

Profile with Instruments, optimize algorithms.

## Deployment

Xcode for building, App Store for distribution.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include nil crashes, retain cycles. Use LLDB debugger.

## Development Setup

Install Xcode, create projects, use SwiftUI for UI.
