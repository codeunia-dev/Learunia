# TypeScript Documentation

This guide introduces TypeScript programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code reliability and maintainability. It compiles to plain JavaScript, allowing seamless integration with existing JS ecosystems. TypeScript supports object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

## TypeScript Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are declared with `let` or `const`, and types can be explicitly annotated. TypeScript introduces static typing while maintaining JavaScript's dynamic nature. Common data types include:

- **String**: Textual data.
- **Number**: Numeric values (integers and floats).
- **Boolean**: True or False values.
- **Array**: Ordered collections.
- **Tuple**: Fixed-length arrays with known types.
- **Enum**: Named constants.
- **Any**: Opt-out of type checking.
- **Void**: Absence of any type.
- **Null** and **Undefined**: Specific absence values.

Type annotations use syntax like `let variable: Type`.

### Strings

Strings support template literals for interpolation and multi-line strings. Methods for manipulation include slicing, replacing, and case conversion.

### Arrays

Arrays are typed collections, supporting generic types like `Array<Type>` or `Type[]`. They include methods for iteration, transformation, and mutation.

### Objects and Interfaces

Objects represent structured data. Interfaces define contracts for object shapes, enabling type checking and IntelliSense.

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

Control flow uses `if`, `else if`, and `else`. The ternary operator and switch statements are also supported.

### Loops

`for`, `for...of`, `for...in`, and `while` loops handle iteration. Array methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` provide functional alternatives.

## Functions

Functions can be typed with parameter and return type annotations. They support default parameters, rest parameters, and overloads. Arrow functions maintain lexical `this`.

## Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

TypeScript enhances JavaScript classes with access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`), abstract classes, and interfaces. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and generics.

## Error Handling

Exception handling uses `try`, `catch`, and `finally`. Custom error classes can extend the built-in `Error` class.

## Modules and Namespaces

Code organization uses ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) and namespaces for grouping related code.

## Generics

Generics enable reusable components that work with multiple types, providing type safety and flexibility.

## Decorators

Decorators are experimental features for meta-programming, allowing modification of classes, methods, and properties at design time.

## Integration with JavaScript

TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, supporting various module systems and targeting different ECMAScript versions.

## Best Practices

Use strict type checking, avoid `any`, and leverage interfaces for contracts. Follow naming conventions and use tools like ESLint for code quality.

## Testing

Testing frameworks like Jest work seamlessly with TypeScript. Type definitions for test libraries ensure type safety.

## Performance Optimization

TypeScript's static analysis helps catch errors early. Compiled output is optimized JavaScript.

## Deployment

TypeScript integrates with build tools like Webpack and Babel for compilation and bundling.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include type errors, compilation failures, and integration with JavaScript libraries. Use `tsc` for compilation and debugging.

## Development Setup

Install TypeScript globally or per-project. Configure `tsconfig.json` for compilation settings. Use IDEs with TypeScript support for better development experience.
