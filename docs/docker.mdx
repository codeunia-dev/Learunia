# Docker Documentation

This guide introduces Docker containerization fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Docker enables packaging applications with dependencies into portable containers. It simplifies deployment, scaling, and environment consistency across development and production.

## Docker Fundamentals

### Images

Read-only templates for containers, built from Dockerfiles.

### Containers

Runnable instances of images, isolated environments.

### Dockerfile

Script defining image build steps.

### Docker Compose

Tool for defining multi-container applications.

## Basic Commands

- `docker build`: Build image from Dockerfile.
- `docker run`: Create and start container.
- `docker ps`: List containers.
- `docker images`: List images.
- `docker stop`: Stop container.
- `docker rm`: Remove container.

## Volumes

Persist data beyond container lifecycle.

## Networks

Connect containers for communication.

## Best Practices

Use multi-stage builds, minimize image layers, and secure containers.

## Orchestration

Kubernetes manages container clusters at scale.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include port conflicts, image build failures, and networking problems. Use `docker logs` for debugging.

## Development Setup

Install Docker Desktop, write Dockerfiles, and integrate with CI/CD.
