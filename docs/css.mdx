# CSS Documentation

This guide introduces CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness, enabling visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces. CSS3 introduces advanced features like animations and flexbox.

## CSS Fundamentals

### Selectors

Selectors target HTML elements for styling. Types include element selectors (`p`), class selectors (`.class`), ID selectors (`#id`), and attribute selectors.

### Properties and Values

CSS properties define styles (e.g., `color`, `font-size`). Values can be keywords, lengths, percentages, or colors.

### Box Model

Every element has content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout.

### Units

Units include pixels (`px`), ems (`em`), rems (`rem`), percentages (`%`), and viewport units (`vw`, `vh`).

## Layout Techniques

### Flexbox

Flexbox provides flexible layouts with properties like `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.

### Grid

CSS Grid creates complex layouts with `display: grid`, grid lines, and areas.

### Positioning

Positioning uses `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` values.

## Typography

Font properties include `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `line-height`. Web fonts are loaded with `@font-face`.

## Colors and Backgrounds

Colors use hex, RGB, HSL, or named values. Backgrounds support images, gradients, and multiple layers.

## Responsive Design

Media queries adapt styles for different screen sizes. Mobile-first design is recommended.

## Animations and Transitions

Transitions smoothly change properties. Keyframes define complex animations.

## CSS Variables

Custom properties (variables) enable reusable values and dynamic theming.

## Specificity and Cascade

CSS rules cascade; specificity determines which rules apply. Use `!important` sparingly.

## Best Practices

Organize CSS with methodologies like BEM or SMACSS. Minimize specificity conflicts and optimize for performance.

## Frameworks and Preprocessors

Frameworks like Bootstrap accelerate development. Preprocessors like Sass extend CSS with variables and functions.

## Browser Compatibility

Use vendor prefixes and tools like Autoprefixer for cross-browser support.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include layout breaks, specificity wars, and cross-browser inconsistencies. Browser dev tools debug styles.

## Development Setup

Use a code editor with CSS support, preview in browsers, and test responsiveness. Build tools like PostCSS enhance workflows.
