# Flutter Documentation

This guide introduces Flutter mobile development fundamentals, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses Dart language and provides fast development with hot reload.

## Flutter Fundamentals

### Widgets

Building blocks of UI. Stateless for static, Stateful for dynamic.

### Dart Language

Object-oriented with async support. Similar to JavaScript but typed.

### Material Design

## App Structure

`main.dart` entry point. `lib/` for code, `pubspec.yaml` for dependencies.

## State Management

Provider, Riverpod, Bloc for complex apps.

## Navigation

Navigator for screen transitions.

## Packages

Pub.dev for third-party libraries.

## Best Practices

Use keys for widgets, optimize builds, and test with Flutter Driver.

## Testing

Unit, widget, integration tests.
