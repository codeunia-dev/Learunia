# Go Documentation

This guide introduces Go programming theory, focusing on concepts and best practices for developers using the Codeunia Learn platform.

## Overview

Go (Golang) is a statically typed, compiled language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency. Developed by Google, it emphasizes readability, fast compilation, and built-in support for concurrent programming, making it ideal for cloud services, networking, and system tools.

## Go Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are declared with `var` or short declaration `:=`. Go is statically typed. Basic types include:

- **bool**: Boolean values.
- **string**: Immutable strings.
- **int/uint**: Signed and unsigned integers (int8, int16, etc.).
- **float32/float64**: Floating-point numbers.
- **complex64/complex128**: Complex numbers.

Composite types include arrays, slices, maps, structs, and channels.

### Strings

Strings are UTF-8 encoded. The `strings` package provides manipulation functions.

### Arrays and Slices

Arrays have fixed size; slices are dynamic views into arrays. Slices support appending and slicing operations.

### Maps

Maps are key-value stores, similar to dictionaries. They are reference types and support built-in operations.

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

`if` statements control branching. No ternary operator; use `if` for concise conditionals.

### Loops

Go has only the `for` loop, which handles all iteration types (counter, range, while-like).

## Functions

Functions are first-class citizens. They can return multiple values and support variadic arguments. Anonymous functions and closures are supported.

## Structs and Methods

Structs define custom types. Methods are functions attached to types, enabling object-oriented programming.

## Interfaces

Interfaces define method sets. Go uses implicit implementation, promoting composition over inheritance.

## Error Handling

Errors are values returned from functions. The `error` interface and `errors` package handle error management. Defer statements ensure cleanup.

## Goroutines and Channels

Concurrency uses goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels for communication. This model simplifies concurrent programming.

## Packages and Modules

Code is organized into packages. Go modules manage dependencies and versioning.

## Best Practices

Follow Go idioms: use short variable names, handle errors explicitly, and prefer composition. Use `gofmt` for consistent formatting.

## Testing

The `testing` package supports unit tests. Benchmarks measure performance.

## Performance Optimization

Go's garbage collector and compilation optimizations provide good performance. Profile with `pprof` for bottlenecks.

## Deployment

Go compiles to single binaries, simplifying deployment. Cross-compilation supports multiple platforms.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include nil pointer dereferences, race conditions, and import errors. Use `go vet` and `go race` for detection.

## Development Setup

Install Go, set up GOPATH or use modules, and use an IDE with Go support. Version control and CI/CD pipelines are recommended.
